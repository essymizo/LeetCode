# LeetCode

It is an online coding platform that allows you to compete, practice and learn coding. 
Has an online IDE for most of the programming languages and analyze code performance real time
The repo has 1000+ coding problems with topics ranging from algorithms, DS, DP etc 
The competition are tougher than Hackerrank (In my opinion) 

Feel free to add to master or fork to create your own
